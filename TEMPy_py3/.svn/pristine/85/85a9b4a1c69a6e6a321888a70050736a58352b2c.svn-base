TEMPy documentation
###############################

TEMPy is an object-oriented Python library designed to help the user in the manipulation and analysis of
macromolecular assemblies, especially in the context of 3D electron microscopy density maps. 
It is designed with a set of functionalities that assess the goodness-of-fit between a given atomic model 
and a density map or between two maps using a variety of different scoring functions. 
It can also generate various ensembles of alternative fits, which has been shown to access one of the 
best-fitting models. In the future, TEMPy will also include a suite of functions for density ﬁtting. 

TEMPy makes use of open source python libraries including `NumPy`_ , 
`SciPy`_ and `Biopython`_ .
TEMPy is flexible, allowing users to build their own functions for specific purposes.

For the use of plotting TEMPy uses `matplotlib`_  but this optional.
 
Warning: Please be aware that this is an alpha version and the tool is under active development.
Bug reports and suggestions are welcome.
