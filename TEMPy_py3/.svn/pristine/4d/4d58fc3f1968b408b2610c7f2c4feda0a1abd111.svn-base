Installation on Linux & Mac OSX 
==========================

**Dependencies**
 
Download TEMpy0.1.tgz from http://XXXXX 
  
In order to make full use of the library in your own python code you will need:
 
1. Python (.=2.X) (http://www.python.org) 
2. NumPy version 1.X or greater (http://numpy.scipy.org) **on my mac 1.6.1**
3. Scipy (http://www.scipy.org/) **on my mac 0.10.0**
4. BioPython (http://biopython.org) 
 
Default installation of these packages requires root (Linux & Mac OSX) privileges. 
An appropriate version of Python is very likely to be available by default on recent Linux and Mac OSX systems and the NumPy, SciPy and BioPython modules can be also installed 
in user directories provided appropriate options are specified in the installation commands and appropriate 
paths set. Please read the installation instructions for these packages carefully. 

**Installation**

| tar xvfz TEMpy0.1.tgz 
| cd TEMpy0.1 
| python test.py  

**NOTE TO SELF: test.py TO DO.** 
The last command tests if TEMpy0.1 and dependencies are installed correctly then this will report “OK””. 
Otherwise, some error message will be generated. Most problems are likely to arise from incorrect 
installation of some of the dependancies and this should be clear from the message.
