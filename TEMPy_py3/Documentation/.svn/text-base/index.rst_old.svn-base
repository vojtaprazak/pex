TEMPy documentation
###############################

TEMPy is a object-oriented Python library designed to help the user manipulate and analyse atomic structures and density maps from 3D EM.
TEMPy will eventually be expanded to include a suite of functions for fitting and the assessment of fits, as well as being a toolkit for users to build their own, personalised, functions. 
TEMPy makes use of open source software including **NumPy** (http://www.numpy.org/), **SciPy** (http://www.scipy.org/) and **Biopython** (http://biopython.org/)

Warning Please be aware that this is alpha software that most definitely contains bugs.
